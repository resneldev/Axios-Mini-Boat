# Intelligent Mini-Boat with Real-Time Water Conductivity Measurement

This project features a self-driving and remote-controlled mini-boat, capable of navigating in both manual and automatic modes. It is equipped with sensors to measure water conductivity in real time, allowing users to monitor variations in water quality during navigation.

The measured data is transmitted via Wi-Fi to a PC, where a dedicated Python application displays it on a dynamic graph, providing an instant visualization of conductivity changes.

The project combines several fields:

- Embedded Electronics: ESP8266, Arduino Mega, DC motors, L298N driver

- Data Acquisition: a DIY made conductivity sensors for accurate water measurement
 
- Wireless Communication: real-time transmission via Wi-Fi (ESP8266)

- Visualization and Analysis: Python application with graphical data display

This mini-boat enables exploration of water environments while collecting precise, real-time information, serving both as an educational tool and as a prototype for environmental monitoring projects.
